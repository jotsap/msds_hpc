## Jeremy Otsap Assignment 2
  
  
**Voyager-EUS2**  
Number 10 spot, and Microsoft Cloud's #1 spot was the Voyager-EUS2 running in US East 2 of Microsoft Azure Cloud. This is huge considering that a cloud computing solution is in the top 10 spot, this introduces opportunities for enormous cost savings for customers who do not have the capital to purchase their own HPC clusters.

**Perlmutter**  
#5 Spot is Perlmutter which is the fastest cluster that does NOT rely on InfiniBand for network connectivity, but rather standard Ethernet

HPE Cray EX235n, AMD EPYC 7763 64C 2.45GHz, NVIDIA A100 SXM4 40 GB, Slingshot-10 in the US site DOE/SC/LBNL/NERSC. Unlike the other two based on a Cluster architecture, this is based on MPP
