Apologies but really struggling with this. I found the makefile for scikit-learn  
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/Makefile

  
I read the documentation and saw it needed the following so made the **spack.yaml** accordingly :  
Python (>= 3.8)  
NumPy (>= 1.17.3)  
SciPy (>= 1.3.2)  
joblib (>= 1.0.0)  
threadpoolctl (>= 2.0.0)
