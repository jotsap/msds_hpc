Apologies but really struggling with this. I found the makefile for scikit-learn  
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/Makefile

  
So I did an alternate makefile exercise for R. Basically just using ggplot to make a plot.  
Please see the **lab03_R.makefile** and the files are in my M2 $HOME directory under the **lab03** folder
